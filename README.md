# Image_Classification_for_Plant_Disease_Detection

## Problem Statement: 
Farmers are facing challenges in identifying andcontrolling plant diseases, resulting in crop losses. The project aims todevelop an image classification model to detect common plant diseasesbased on images of plant leaves.

### Objectives:
1. Acquire and preprocess a dataset of plant images with disease labels.
2. Build a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification.
3. Provide insights into the types of diseases thr model can accurately identify.

### Key Tasks:
1. Collect and preprocess a dataset of plant images.
2. Implement a CNN architecture for image classification.
3. Train the  model and fine-tune hyperparameters.
4. Evaluate the model's  performance using a test dataset.
5. Visualize and interpret the model's prediction.

### Scope:
1. Data acquisition and preprocessing.
2. CNN model development and training.
3. Model evaluation and interpretation.
4. Presentation of findings and insights.
